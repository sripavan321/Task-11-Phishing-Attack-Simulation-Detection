# Task-11-Phishing-Attack-Simulation-Detection
This task focuses on understanding how phishing attacks are executed and how they can be identified and prevented. The objective is to simulate a phishing scenario in a controlled environment and apply detection techniques.

1. Phishing Attack Simulation

A mock phishing campaign was designed to replicate real-world attack methods, such as fake login pages or deceptive email messages. The simulation demonstrates how attackers trick users into revealing sensitive information.

Objective: Understand attacker techniques and common phishing strategies.

2. Email & URL Analysis

Suspicious emails and links were analyzed for red flags such as:

Spoofed sender addresses

Urgent or threatening language

Mismatched or shortened URLs

Suspicious attachments

Objective: Identify indicators of phishing attempts.

3. Detection Techniques

Various detection methods were explored, including:

Header analysis

Domain reputation checks

SSL certificate verification

Spam filtering tools

Objective: Learn how security systems and users detect phishing attacks.

4. Prevention & Mitigation

Best practices were implemented to reduce phishing risks, such as:

User awareness training

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Email security configurations (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)

Reporting and incident response procedures

Objective: Strengthen organizational defense against phishing attacks.
